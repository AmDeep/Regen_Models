Models created for Data Science Case Competition Regen 2020


# RStudio Analysis
RStudio was used for cleaning and generating columnar values for the class columns that were again standarized to produce better tuned results. 

# Python Analysis
Python was used for performing model development for the normalized version of the dataset where algorithms like adaboost, Randomforest, RandomTree etc were used and compared. Python played a decisive role in determining which of the inputs and outputs offer greatest correlational values and the feature importance of the variables.

This is further evidenced by the use of PCA to show the maximum variance that can be reached when using the these models. Correlational plots, feature importance plots, PCA plots and confusion matrix plots were generated using Python.
# WEKA Analysis

Performed using conventional algorithms to produce the best values, we arrived at general alorithms that produced an accuracy that was well above 80%. The objective here was to better interpret the relationship between the input and the output. The files for the best models created from WEKA are stored in the model files along with the buffer which shows the statistics for the models generated. Clearly, SGD and SVM produce the best accuracies.
